    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      My name is Tjeerd Verhagen and as a _freelance_ Full Stack Developer / DevOps Engineer I have more than 20 years of experience. During my career I have always shown interest in all aspects of development. From initial customer need to running software in the production environment. Apart from the technical knowledge required for this, I am also interested in what methods there are to organize the work, how to get the most out of a team. If it happens that way, I like to give a presentation or workshop and thereby inspire others, so that they can make a flying start.

        During the conversion of the application _Handmatig Opvoeren Betalingen_, from WebSphere v8.5 to WebSphere v9.0, I've solved a nasty bug!

        Initially I've been adding and updating existing Robot Framework scripts, but soon the question was asked if this is the best way to regression test the functional requirements. Also learning curve for Robot Framework is quite high and maintainability quite hard. After setting up a POC for Cucumber as well as Karate API Testing, the team decided in favor of Cucumber. It looks better maintainable and is a lot developer friendly! An additional advantange, which was 'discovered' during the conversion of some inital Robot Framwork test to Cucumber scenario's, was the abbility to debug!

      details: |
        As team member of the Search Team, I simplified the Integration Tests, by using a locally launched (and stopped) Elasticsearch Node, through Maven. Instead of through a Docker instance. This makes it easier and faster. As well as easier to change to a newer version for testing.

        Developed a Maven plug-in, which creates an Elastic script, for creating index, mapping and initial data filling.

        Designed the architecture for a Time-Machine based File-Store as well as developed it, with use of Verticles from Vert.x (comparable with Actors in Akka). Through this implementation of the File Store, there are stable data sets available. Which is a great improvement for testing. There is a restful interface, which makes it possible to directly upload a specific set of documents into a specific Elasticsearch cluster.

        The development of TotalPatentOne is in a crucial phase, as they like to replace the older TotalPatent solution by the new version.
        One of the most critical pieces, the TPO search language, contained several issues.
        As member of the search team, I was involved in defining the search specific grammar for patent documents. This search grammar is written in Antlr4.
        Based on the generated Antlr classes, we implemented the TPO query model, which is a tree model. This tree is then used by several visitors, for optimizing the tree, calculating search complexity, validating specific input details. And finally to create the ElasticSearch specific query.

        As a member of the Continuous Integration and Delivery Deployment Team, there were a lot of challenges. As a team we were dealing with the transition from a green field project to a service delivery team. The green field project was set up to automatically roll out the new RedHat-based environments for all DevOps team within DUO.
        An important part of this is the Provisioning Self Service Portal, through which developers and testers can request and manage their own environment (s). This means that they have their own JBoss EAP instances at their disposal. Possibly supplemented with Static Content instances and database schema links. Where test data can be loaded if necessary.

        In addition to the AC-Server, there are a large number of AC-Interfaces, with which financial data from data vendors can be loaded in the AC-Server in a standardized manner. The changes that the various data vendors implement in their product can have an effect on the corresponding AC-Interface.
        In addition to adjusting the various interfaces, Tjeerd has worked to improve the (automated) testability, improve the development process, improve the Continuous Integration and professionalize the accompanying documentation. Generating PDFs and HTML based on DocBook XML.
        In doing so, he wrote, among AC-Interface functionality, Maven-Plug-ins, Eclipse-Plugins and Junit extensions. With these JUnit extentions specific AC-Interface tests, could be run like Junit tests.

      task: AC-Desktop 3.x
      details: |
        The existing AC-Desktop was not user-friendly and had arisen from a technical approach. As a result, AC-Desktop 2.x was unnecessarily complex for the largest group of end users. The development of AC-Desktop 3 is based on the users who do data handling. The desktop is a Swing application, which connects to the AC Server. This allows the end users to gain insight into the financial data stored in the AC Server. Tjeerd has done both part of the development and looked at the continuous integration system. Until then, Ant was used in combination with Continuous Integration. In this project, the existing system was also used (trial run) with Maven, Hudson and Nexus.

      details: |
        Based on the change request from the customer, adjustments had to be made to the Service Order Gateway (SOG) client application, in which Tjeerd functioned as a developer.
        To gain more insight into the functioning of the application, Tjeerd has made a number of UML diagrams of the application to supplement the existing documentation. With the knowledge and experience from previous projects with regard to automatic build and release processes, Tjeerd has implemented a number of changes, making it easy to compile, run and test the application both on the local workstations and on the server.
        Partly on the advice of Tjeerd during the project was chosen to change source version management tool, the choice is made for cvs.

      task: Pims
      details: |
        For PIMS, Tjeerd defined the architecture of this web application.The techniques to be used had already been recorded and consisted of Java, JSP, Tomcat and Oracle. Various open source components were added for such things as logging, database connection pooling, user input validation and unit testing. Furthermore, the MVC concept was chosen as the basis for the web application. POJOs were used to transport information within the application. These were generated on the basis of an XML schema. In the development use was made of open standards such as XML, XML schema, CSS and HTML 4.
        When designing the application, the viewed design patterns for web applications such as MVC, DAO, Plug-In were used as much as possible.In addition, the source code version management set up and introduced to the other team members. This supplemented with build, test and release scripts.

      details: |
        The Tibco middleware consists of a number of basic products and an extensive range of standard adapters for various back-office systems. However, there is no standard adapter for the Cordaptix billing package.
        The technical design for this had to be made first. It was very important to get a quick insight into the functioning of the various back-office systems that sent Tibco messages towards Cordaptix. As a starting point for thecommunication with Cordaptix served the new interface based on XML-SOAP. When designing as much use as possible of design patterns noted in UML. The implementation has been done by means of Tibco adapter SDK. In addition, use was made of various open source standards and components, such as XML, XML Schema, FreeMarker, log4j, etc.
