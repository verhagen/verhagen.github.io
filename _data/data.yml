    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      My name is Tjeerd Verhagen and as a _freelance_ Full Stack Developer / DevOps Engineer I have more than 20 years of experience. During my career I have always shown interest in all aspects of development. From initial customer need to running software in the production environment. Apart from the technical knowledge required for this, I am also interested in what methods there are to organize the work, how to get the most out of a team. If it happens that way, I like to give a presentation or workshop and thereby inspire others, so that they can make a flying start.

        As a member of the Continuous Integration and Delivery Deployment Team, there were a lot of challenges. As a team we were dealing with the transition from a green field project to a service delivery team. The green field project was set up to automatically roll out the new RedHat-based environments for all DevOps team within DUO.
        An important part of this is the Provisioning Self Service Portal, through which developers and testers can request and manage their own environment (s). This means that they have their own JBoss EAP instances at their disposal. Possibly supplemented with Static Content instances and database schema links. Where test data can be loaded if necessary.

          - Infrastructure as Code
          - Immutable Infrastructure
          - Infrastructure as a Service
